      question: "Am I eligible to apply for a Schengen visa?",
      answer:
        "Eligibility to apply for a Schengen visa generally depends on your nationality, the purpose of your travel, and the specific country you are applying to. Please ensure you meet the general requirements such as valid travel documents, sufficient financial means, travel insurance, and a clear purpose for your visit.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What do I need to prepare for the visa application or visa interview?",
      answer:
        "You will need to schedule an appointment and provide a list of required documents. These typically include your passport, visa application form, photographs, travel insurance, financial proof, accommodation details, and travel itinerary. You may also need to submit additional documents based on the purpose of your visit (tourism, business, etc.).",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How long will it take to receive my passport after the visa interview?",
      answer:
        "Typically, it takes 4 to 5 days to process your visa application. However, the maximum processing time may take up to 2 weeks, depending on the embassy or consulateâ€™s workload and any additional checks that may be required.",
    },
    {
      question: "For how long will I be granted the visa?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "How can I get a visa for a longer duration?",
      answer:
        "You can request a visa for a longer duration (such as one or two years) by mentioning your desired visa duration in your cover letter. If you have a good Schengen travel history, there is a higher chance of being granted a visa for a year or even two years.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I travel to all Schengen countries with one visa?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my visa is rejected?",
      answer:
        "If your visa is rejected and the reason for rejection is provided, you can address the issue by correcting your documentation and reapplying. If no reason is given, carefully review your application and documents. You may also appeal directly to the embassy or consulate. If there are any gaps or mistakes, ensure these are corrected before reapplying.",
